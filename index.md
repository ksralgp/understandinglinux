# Understanding Linux

One of the joys of Linux is learning how the OS and popular user-space applications work. The availability of source code makes it possible to understand almost anything, but this approach can be a slog. Books, blog-posts, documentation, mailing list archives actually make it possible. The intent of this project is to document my understanding of various parts of Linux.
